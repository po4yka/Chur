# Device Identity

> **Status:** Proposed future protocol

Device identity authenticates sync operations, enrollment, and collection grants. It is separate from transport authentication and from local vault-unlock credentials.

## 1. Key separation

Proposed per-device keys:

```text
Ed25519 signing key pair
X25519 HPKE/key-agreement key pair
```

Do not reuse one key pair across signature and KEM roles. Public keys are server-visible; private keys are wrapped under a root-derived identity key and optionally additionally gated by platform protection.

## 2. Device identifier

`device_id` is random and bound to public keys through a signed enrollment record. User-facing device names are encrypted private metadata and are not cryptographic identifiers.

## 3. Enrollment

Initial device:

1. create vault/account and identity keys locally;
2. sign self-enrollment/root device record;
3. publish public record;
4. store private keys encrypted under root identity domain.

Additional device:

1. authenticate account transport;
2. generate keys on new device;
3. existing authorized device or recovery flow verifies new keys;
4. authorized device signs enrollment including capabilities and sequence;
5. server relays signed record;
6. new device receives required encrypted root/collection state;
7. all devices update accepted membership.

Email/server login alone must not authorize a new decryption identity.

## 4. Enrollment record

Conceptual fields:

```text
protocol_version
account/vault identity binding
device_id
signing_public_key
hpke_public_key
key_versions
capabilities
created_sequence
issuer_device_id
membership_generation
previous_membership_commitment
bootstrap_checkpoint_commitment
issuer_signature
```

Canonical encoding and signature domain are versioned.

`bootstrap_checkpoint_commitment` is BLAKE3-256 over the issuing device's current `CheckpointV1`, defined in [`ROLLBACK_PROTECTION.md`](ROLLBACK_PROTECTION.md) §6. Together with `membership_generation` it is the enrolling device's signed statement of what the vault's history was at enrollment, and it is what gives the new device a freshness floor before it has one of its own. It is 32 bytes, so it also fits the out-of-band payload of §5; the checkpoint record itself is fetched through the server and accepted only when it hashes to this value.

## 5. Verification

The device fingerprint is the one value every platform displays for a device:

```text
device_fingerprint = BLAKE3-256(
      "CHUR\x00IDENTITY\x00FINGERPRINT\x00V1"
   || vault/account binding:bytes[16]
   || device_id:bytes[16]
   || signing_public_key:bytes[32]
   || hpke_public_key:bytes[32]
)
```

The domain tag is a fixed ASCII byte constant with no length prefix, allocated in [`../format/CANONICAL_ENCODING_V1.md`](../format/CANONICAL_ENCODING_V1.md) §15.5; the four elements follow in the order above with no length prefixes, 96 bytes of input in total. Both public keys enter it, so substituting either one changes the string.

Display is the leading 160 bits of the digest as 40 lowercase hexadecimal digits, most significant byte first, in ten groups of four separated by one space: a 49-character string, identical on Android, iOS, and the CLI, never truncated further and never re-grouped by locale.

160 bits is the security parameter. A server substituting a device's keys must find a key pair whose leading 160 digest bits match those of the real device, a preimage search of about 2^160 operations. A birthday collision between two key pairs of the server's own choosing costs about 2^80 and does not help, because the user compares against a fixed real device. A shorter spoken string was rejected: one string per device removes the chance of comparing the weaker of two.

The QR payload is the same 96 bytes of digest input, encoded as binary. The scanner recomputes the fingerprint from those bytes and compares it against the enrollment record it holds; it never trusts a rendered string carried inside the code. An enrollment QR additionally carries the 32-byte `bootstrap_checkpoint_commitment` of §4, 128 bytes in total.

Users verify a device through:

- QR scan between the two devices;
- comparison of the 40 digits, read aloud or side by side;
- comparison on an existing authorized device;
- recovery-mediated approval.

Server-displayed names alone are not proof. Which of these is required and which is optional is fixed by [`SERVER_TRUST_MODEL.md`](SERVER_TRUST_MODEL.md) §7.

## 6. Private-key protection

- encrypted at rest under dedicated root-derived domain;
- loaded only in authenticated session for signing/decryption operations;
- zeroized/evicted on lock;
- not stored in public Room/DataStore;
- portable recovery behavior explicitly chosen;
- no export through general FFI/application API.

Optional Secure Enclave/Android hardware identity keys require separate suite and interoperability ADR; default portable Rust keys simplify recovery and protocol consistency.

## 7. Sequence and signing

Every device maintains a strictly increasing operation sequence. Signatures bind:

```text
device_id
sequence
previous operation hash
operation bytes
protocol version
```

Private key use must not sign arbitrary server-provided bytes without domain/context validation.

## 8. Rotation

Key rotation creates a signed replacement record:

- new key generated locally;
- old signing key authorizes transition when available;
- recovery/quorum procedure used if old key unavailable;
- sequence and previous membership commitment prevent silent replacement;
- old key retained only for historical signature verification;
- compromise event may require collection epoch rotation.

## 9. Revocation

Revocation is a signed membership operation. `RevokeDeviceRecordV1` is the payload of the `RevokeDevice` kind:

```text
protocol_version
account/vault identity binding
revoked_device_id
final_accepted_device_sequence
final_accepted_operation_digest
membership_generation
issuer_device_id
previous_membership_commitment
issuer_signature
```

The pair (`final_accepted_device_sequence`, `final_accepted_operation_digest`) is the accepted revocation point. The sequence is the highest the issuer had accepted from the revoked device; the digest is that operation's `operation_digest` per [`OPERATION_LOG.md`](OPERATION_LOG.md) §4, so the point names one branch and not merely a length, and `membership_generation` fixes which membership state the point belongs to. Canonical encoding and signature domain are versioned with the enrollment record of §4. Acceptance of operations against this point is normative in [`REVOCATION.md`](REVOCATION.md) §7.

After acceptance:

- future root/collection envelopes are not issued to device;
- collection keys rotate per [`REVOCATION.md`](REVOCATION.md) §3;
- server tokens are revoked;
- old signatures remain verifiable;
- previously downloaded keys/plaintext remain outside enforceable deletion.

## 10. Device loss and recovery

A user can remove a lost device from another authorized device or recovery session. If every identity device is lost, recovery must bootstrap a new root membership state without trusting server key substitution. This flow requires explicit operation/log rules.

## 11. Multi-vault/decoy

Real and decoy identities do not share device private keys or membership by default. Correlating them through the same sync account would weaken decoy goals and requires a separate product decision.

## 12. Tests

- enrollment happy path and key substitution;
- duplicate/stale device ID;
- wrong issuer/signature/domain;
- sequence rollback/fork;
- key rotation with/without old device;
- revocation and stale operation rejection;
- recovery bootstrap;
- private-key storage/lock lifecycle;
- cross-platform signature/HPKE vectors.
