# Architecture Decision Records

> **Status:** Accepted ADR process, template, and index

ADRs record durable architectural choices, alternatives, consequences, and security impact. They explain **why** a decision exists; normative format and behavior remain in focused specifications.

## Status values

An ADR uses the document-status vocabulary defined once in [`../README.md`](../README.md#document-status): **Proposed**, **Accepted**, **Experimental**, **Deprecated**, **Superseded**, or **Rejected**. An ADR spells the superseded label `Superseded by ADR-NNNN` so the metadata line names the replacement.

## Template

```markdown
# ADR-NNNN: Title

- Status: Proposed
- Date: YYYY-MM-DD
- Decision owners: ...
- Related: links

## Context

## Decision

## Alternatives considered

## Consequences

### Positive

### Tradeoffs

## Security impact

## Compatibility impact

## Validation

## Follow-up
```

`Security impact` covers privacy impact and names the affected `SEC-` identifiers from [`../security/SECURITY_INVARIANTS.md`](../security/SECURITY_INVARIANTS.md). `Compatibility impact` covers migration and downgrade behavior. A Proposed ADR may title its validation section `Validation required before acceptance`.

## Process

- create an ADR for a decision affecting ownership, trust boundary, persisted/wire bytes, key lifecycle, major dependency, platform security policy, or release gate;
- do not edit the historical decision into a different choice after acceptance; supersede it with a new ADR;
- update related normative docs and vectors in the same change or state the sequencing explicitly;
- accepted ADRs must identify unresolved proposals and evidence required;
- security-sensitive ADRs require a second reviewer when possible.

## Future ADR backlog

This list registers the decisions that still require an ADR. [`../ARCHITECTURE.md`](../ARCHITECTURE.md) §43 points here and keeps no list of its own. [`../CRYPTOGRAPHY.md`](../CRYPTOGRAPHY.md) §74 is the second register: it tracks every open cryptographic decision item by item and annotates each one as it is resolved, and an item there is copied here only when it needs an ADR of its own. An entry leaves this list only when an accepted ADR, or a specification of rank 1 to rank 3 in the [authority hierarchy](../README.md#authority-hierarchy), records the decision.

- the exact password input maximum, [`../CRYPTOGRAPHY.md`](../CRYPTOGRAPHY.md) §74 item 5, which [`../security/PASSWORD_PROFILE.md`](../security/PASSWORD_PROFILE.md) §3 proposes as 1024 encoded bytes and does not freeze; the rest of that profile is decided, the Unicode rules in §3 there, the Argon2id floor and default in §4 and [`0026`](0026-argon2id-memory-floor-and-candidate-set.md), and the Argon2 parser bounds in [`../CRYPTOGRAPHY.md`](../CRYPTOGRAPHY.md) §18.3;
- Android Keystore and iOS Keychain exact policies, including the Apple slot representation that [`../security/KEY_SLOTS.md`](../security/KEY_SLOTS.md) §5 leaves open between a protected `DeviceUnlockSecret` and wrapped root bytes held directly as the Keychain secret;
- device identity portability, including whether the optional Secure Enclave or Android hardware identity keys of [`../sync/DEVICE_IDENTITY.md`](../sync/DEVICE_IDENTITY.md) §6 become a second suite;
- post-quantum recipient profile per [`../CRYPTOGRAPHY.md`](../CRYPTOGRAPHY.md) §56 and [`../sync/COLLECTION_GRANTS.md`](../sync/COLLECTION_GRANTS.md) §11.
