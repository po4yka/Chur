//! The encrypted catalog connection.
//!
//! `docs/format/CATALOG_SCHEMA_V1.md` §15 puts the physical database behind
//! SQLCipher opened directly by Rust, and ADR-0004 makes the connection, the
//! key, and the lifecycle Rust-owned. This module is that boundary: nothing
//! outside it holds a `rusqlite::Connection`, and nothing outside `chur-crypto`
//! produces the key it opens with.
//!
//! The key never reaches SQLCipher's own password KDF. `CatalogKey` is already
//! a full-entropy HKDF output under the `chur/v1/root/catalog-database` label,
//! so the connection uses the raw-key pragma; running PBKDF2 over it would add
//! cost without adding entropy and would put a second KDF profile into the
//! at-rest format.
