//! The `backup` command group.
//!
//! `docs/format/BACKUP_FORMAT_V1.md` §1 makes the package portable across
//! Android, iOS, and the CLI, and `docs/ROADMAP.md` Phase 2 makes a restore on
//! all three an exit criterion. All three run one implementation; what differs
//! is the file it is pointed at, which is why this module is thin.
//!
//! Nothing here prints private content. A summary is a set of counts and one
//! identifier, which §9 already lists among the things the outer package
//! reveals to anyone holding it.
