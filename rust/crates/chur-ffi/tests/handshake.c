/*
 * The C side of the FFI harness.
 *
 * docs/interop/FFI_CONTRACT.md section 2 says the handshake is what a platform
 * gate checks before a vault opens. This program is that gate, in C, linked
 * against the real static library, so the harness proves the symbols exist
 * with C linkage and the declared types rather than proving that Rust agrees
 * with Rust.
 *
 * It then drives the control plane and the data plane of section 6.2 the way a
 * host does: open a runtime, refuse a wrong credential, and prove that every
 * exported symbol links. Creating a vault is not on the boundary, so a full
 * round trip belongs to the Rust integration tests; what a C program can prove
 * and a Rust test cannot is that these symbols exist with these signatures.
 *
 * Build and run:
 *
 *   cargo build -p chur-ffi --release
 *   cc -I crates/chur-ffi/include crates/chur-ffi/tests/handshake.c \
 *      target/release/libchur_ffi.a -o handshake && ./handshake
