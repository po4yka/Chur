//! Panic containment at the boundary.
//!
//! `docs/interop/FFI_CONTRACT.md` §11 is unconditional: every exported symbol
//! wraps its whole body in `catch_unwind`, no "where applicable" exemption, and
//! the panic payload is dropped inside the boundary so no payload text crosses
//! it. The FFI artifacts build with `panic = "unwind"` for exactly this reason;
//! abort would convert a contained, redactable failure into a process kill that
//! skips session zeroization and removes the public shell along with the vault
//! (ADR-0016).
//!
//! A status-returning export converts a caught panic into `INTERNAL_FAILURE`.
//! The handshake exports of §2 have no status channel: they return a scalar and
//! cannot fail. [ADR-0037] fixes what they return instead — a value the host
//! already knows how to refuse, so a panicking library fails the gate rather
//! than reporting a version it did not compute.
//!
