     * session, because a restore installs an identity and there may be no
     * session and no vault when it starts; and the credential is the package's
     * own, taken from its portable descriptor at step 2.
     *
     * The source is the host's rather than the [ExportSink]'s. An export
     * destination is one the application creates; a package is a file the user
     * picks, which is a platform picker and not a call. Rust duplicates the
     * descriptor at the boundary, §13 of the FFI contract, so the host may
     * close its own as soon as this returns; [close] returns it here rather
     * than at the host so one lambda ends the attempt on a refusal exactly as
     * on a success, and a descriptor the application keeps is a file the
     * platform cannot reclaim.
     *
     * The bracket is [enrollDeviceSlot]'s, for a longer reason. A restore is
     * the longest operation here, and a background transition during one would
     * move the shell to the public route and take the restore screen, and the
     * progress it shows, with it.
     *
     * The repository published `NoVault` and nothing has asked it since;
     * `start` is that question, it opens no runtime that is already open, and
     * it is what moves the shell from creation to the unlock gate.
     *
     * The message is the status's [userCopy] and nothing more, as every other
     * boundary failure's is: `docs/ERROR_MODEL.md` "Safe metadata" keeps a
     * private value out of it, and the package's password is one. [close] is
     * told whether the user cancelled, so the route can show that calmly
     * rather than as a failure (principle 4 of the same document) without
     * reading the text, which its "Layer mapping" forbids a branch on.
