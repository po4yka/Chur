 * Unsaved private-note text that an ordinary lock saves as a new revision
 * before the native session closes, `PRIVATE_NOTES.md`.
 *
 * A source captures its text on the lock's UI turn, before concealment
 * disposes the editor; the capture is the editor's last action. The lock
 * conceals first and then runs [save], which waits at most [boundMs].
 *
 * The bound has one limit. A save checks `proceed` while it holds the
 * repository mutex, just before its native call, so no save starts after
 * the bound or after [abort]. A native call that already started cannot be
 * pre-empted, and the native close waits for the mutex. So the close comes
 * at most [boundMs] plus the rest of one bounded note transaction after the
 * lock, the same wait as for any other native call in flight.
 *
 * Panic calls [abort]: the wait of an earlier ordinary lock ends at once,
 * and its saves that have not started never start, `DISCREET_MODE.md`.
 *
 * Only Main calls these members.
